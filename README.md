The repository is divided into 5 branches, each with a different project covering a range of programming fields.

1) The first repository, algorithm analisys, focuses on different sorting and searching algorithms, and calculates the average operation and time cost of each method, from linear and binary search algrotihms to Insert Sort, Quick Sort or Heap Sort sorting algorithms.

2) The second one, Anthill Game, is a 4 person project aimed to improve our cooperation and coordination between programmers, and to learn how to organise and thoroughly test each module within the proyect.
