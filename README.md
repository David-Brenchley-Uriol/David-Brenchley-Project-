# David-Brenchley-Project-
David Brenchleyâ€™s main projects:

The repository is divided into 5 branches, each with a different project covering a range of programming fields.

1) The first branch contains a Synchronized Block-Change Simulation, consisting of different mining processes that compete between themselves to obtain coins by calculating a Proof of Work function. Such coding granted me a solid understanding of concurrency and synchronization between processes, using both linux semaphores, signals and queues, apart from threads to improve mining perfomance in each process. 

2) The second project, Algorithm Analysis, focuses on different sorting and searching algorithms, and calculates the average operation and time cost of each method, from linear and binary search algorithms to Insert Sort, Quick Sort or Heap Sort algorithms.

3) The third one, Anthill Game, is a 4 person project aimed to improve the cooperation and coordination between programmers, learning how to organise and thoroughly test each module within the project at the same time. It also taught us how to properly document our work.

4)  In fourth place there is a Network Communication project developed in Python using the .pcap library. The code itselves supports the first 4 layers of the Osi module, capable of establishing a real network channel with external devices through TCP, UDP, IP and Ethernet protocols.

5)  The final branch contains a miniature data base developed in C, composed of an index file, a data file, and all the required functions to manage such database, serving as an introduction to the underlying software in real data bases. During such course we also learnt SQL quite extensively.


Due to university policy, all of the projects were developed mainly in C or in Python, however, we have also adquired an
solid understanding in C++ and in other languages like SQL or Matlab.
