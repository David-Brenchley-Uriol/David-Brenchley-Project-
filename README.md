# David-Brenchley-Project-
David Brenchleyâ€™s main projects 

The repository is divided into 5 branches, each with a different project covering a range of programming fields.

1) The first branch contains

2) The second repository, algorithm analisys, focuses on different sorting and searching algorithms, and calculates the average operation and time cost of each method, from linear and binary search algrotihms to Insert Sort, Quick Sort or Heap Sort algorithms.

3) The third one, Anthill Game, is a 4 person project aimed to improve our cooperation and coordination between programmers, and to learn how to organise and thoroughly test each module within the proyect.

4)  In fourth place there is a Network Communication project developed in Python using the .pcap library. The code itselves supports the first 4 layers of the Osi module, being capable of establishing a real network channel with external devices through TCP, UDP, IP and Ethernet protocols.

5)  The final branch, contains a miniature data base developed in C, composed of an index and the data file and all the required functions to manage such database, serving as an introduction to the underlying software in real data bases. During such course we also learnt SQL quite extensively
